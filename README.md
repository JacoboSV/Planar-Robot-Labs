## Easy Planar Robot Labs

The planar robots labs files included allow to build or to simulate two different planar robot architectures.

### The 4R robot

It is based on the analysis of the geometry of the closed loop structure. It is a  1 DOF planar robot with four rotational joints (4R), is usually called the 4R linkage, and has two fixed pivots. The mathematical model can be obtained using common kinematics analysis.

### The 5R robot

The 5R linkage simulation is based also on the analysis of the geometry of the closed loop structure. It uses two inputs for the two rotational joints.  It is a 2 DOFs planar robot with five rotational joints (5R).

### The NR robot

A planar manipulator with a variable number of DOF (NR). This architecture is not a closed chain of joints, and the minimum example is a 2 DOFs, two joints planar robot. The arm distances are fixed and the system contains only rotational joints. The mathematical model can be obtained using mathematics.
